Fast local code intelligence for humans and AI agents.

Lexa turns a codebase into a portable, queryable graph so every tool can work from the same stable view of the project.

Instead of repeatedly scanning files ad hoc, Lexa indexes structure, text, symbols, imports, content hashes, and recent edits into one local graph. That method gives agents compact context, traceable lookups, hash-aware reads, and atomic line-based patches.
```
lexa index .
lexa text-search "handle_request" --sc
lexa outline src/main.rs
lexa audit
lexa mcp .
```

## Why Lexa
Lexa is built around an index-first workflow:

Build one local graph for the project.
Query that graph for paths, symbols, text, outlines, imports, and context.
Read and patch files with content hashes so edits can be checked against the version that was inspected.
That makes Lexa useful as a shared context layer between a developer, a terminal workflow, and an AI agent.
## Install
macOS and Linux:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvia-hq/lexa/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:
```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvia-hq/lexa/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Install a specific version:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anvia-hq/lexa/main/install.sh | sh -s -- v0.5.1
```

From source:
```
cargo install --path .
```

Upgrade an installed release:
```
lexa upgrade
lexa upgrade v0.5.1
lexa upgrade --install-dir "$HOME/.local/bin"
```

`upgrade` updates the Lexa binary in the directory containing the currently running `lexa`, unless `--install-dir` or `LEXA_INSTALL_DIR` is set. To refresh a    project's graph, run `lexa index .`.

Check the installed version:
```
lexa --version
```
`--version` prints the current binary version and, when possible, uses a short cached GitHub release check to report whether `lexa upgrade` is available. Set `LEXA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable this check.

Or build without installing:
```
cargo build --release
./target/release/lexa --help
```
Make sure Cargo's bin directory is on your `PATH`:
```
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```
## Quick Start
```
lexa index /path/to/project
cd /path/to/project

lexa files
lexa text-search "handle_request"
lexa outline src/main.rs
lexa symbol-defs Engine
lexa read src/main.rs -L 1-80
```

`index` writes the graph to `.lexa/graph.lexa` by default and shows a branded banner in interactive terminals. Commands run from the project root will read that graph automatically.

Use a custom graph path:
```
lexa --graph /tmp/project.graph.lexa index /path/to/project
lexa --graph /tmp/project.graph.lexa text-search "Parser"
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `index <path>` | Index a project and write a graph |
| `reindex [path]` | Rebuild the project graph |
| `clear-index` | Remove the project graph |
| `files [path]` | Show indexed files, optionally filtered |
| `list [path]` | List directory children |
| `glob <pattern>` | Match indexed paths |
| `path-search <pattern>` | Fuzzy path search |
| `text-search <query>` | Search indexed text |
| `outline <path>` | Show imports and symbols |
| `symbol-defs <name>` | Find exact symbol definitions |
| `symbol-search <query>` | Fuzzy symbol search |
| `word-refs <word>` | Find exact word or identifier occurrences, including definitions |
| `callers <name>` | Find non-definition call sites/usages |
| `trace-deps <path>` | Trace resolved project-file imports |
| `brief <task>` | Bundle context for an explicit code task |
| `read <path>` | Read a file or line range |
| `patch <path> <op>` | Apply a line-based edit |
| `create <path>` | Create a file safely |
| `changes [since]` | Show session-local changes |
| `recent` | Show recently modified files |
| `status` | Show index status |
| `audit` | Run a review-oriented architecture audit |
| `upgrade [version]` | Upgrade the lexa binary, not a project index |
| `watch [path]` | Refresh graph on file changes |
| `pipeline <pipeline>` | Chain query operations |
| `mcp [path]` | Start MCP over stdo; returns text-only tool content by default |

Useful search flags:
```
lexa text-search "render" --scope
lexa text-search --regex "render[A-Z]\\w+"
lexa text-search "useEffect" --path-glob "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
lexa text-search "TODO" --compact --paths-only
lexa symbol-search createAgent
```

Useful file listing flags:
```
lexa files apps/desktop --language typescript
lexa files --path-glob "**/*.{ts,tsx}" --max-lines 200
lexa files packages --min-lines 100 --max-results 20
```

`files [path]` treats `path` as a project-relative prefix. Use `list [path]` when you want only immediate directory children.

`word-refs` includes declarations and definitions. `callers` is narrower: it returns non-definition call sites/usages and skips declaration-like occurrences such as type aliases. `trace-deps` reports resolved project files; external packages are not returned as dependency nodes, and unresolved local imports are reported separately for `depends_on`.

`Use brief` as a context bundler with explicit symbols, path fragments, or scoped keywords. It is not a natural-language QA tool:
```
lexa brief createAgentRuntimeForRun
lexa brief "terminal session" --path-prefix apps/desktop
lexa brief "createProjectAgent packages/agents" --path-prefix packages/agents --max 8
```

If a brief query is vague, Lexa marks it low-confidence and suggests concrete next steps such as `symbol-search`, `text-search`, or adding scope filters.

`pipeline` supports `glob/find`, `fuzzy/path_search`, `search/text_search`, `filter`, `outline`, `deps`, `read`, `sort`, `limit`, and `count`. The pipe string form is intended for advanced CLI use. MCP clients should prefer the `steps` array form, where each array item is one pipeline step. For MCP pipeline calls, put search terms inside the step itself: `{"steps":["search AgentRunRequest","limit 3"]}`. Alternatively, pass the full pipe string as `pipeline`: `{"pipeline":"search AgentRunRequest | limit 3"}`.

MCP omits duplicated `structuredContent` by default to reduce token use. Start with lexa mcp . `--structured-content` or `lexa mcp . --json` when a client needs JSON structured tool results.

Safe edit example:
```
lexa read src/main.rs --hash
lexa patch src/main.rs replace -L 12 --if-hash <hash> --content '    println!("updated");'
lexa create src/new_file.rs --content 'pub fn new_file() {}'
```
Audit a project for structural review risk:
```
lexa audit
lexa --json audit
lexa audit --max 50
lexa audit --since main
lexa audit --since main --strict
lexa audit --config lexa.toml
lexa audit --no-config
lexa audit --include dead-code
```

`audit` is read-only. It flags import cycles, large files, large symbols, and dependency hotspots from the indexed graph. It is not a compiler, typechecker, linter, test runner, or build verifier. A clean Lexa audit never means the project compiles; run the repository's normal verification command before claiming implementation work is complete. Use `--since` to scope findings to changed files and their direct dependency context. Use `--strict` to return a non-zero exit code when high-severity structural findings are present. Config is optional; Lexa discovers `lexa.toml` or `.lexa/audit.toml` unless `--config` or `--no-config` is used. Dead-code candidates are read-only and off by default; enable them with `--include dead-code` or config. Generated artifacts are ignored by default across common languages and frameworks, including generated directories, protobuf/gRPC outputs, Android/Qt/Dart/C#/OpenAPI/GraphQL outputs, lockfiles, build output, dependency folders, and common tool-specific files like `worker-configuration.d.ts`, `routeTree.gen.ts`, and Drizzle metadata.

Findings include an `actionability` classification and `next_steps` hints in JSON/MCP output. `actionable` means the finding is a likely refactor target, `candidate` means verify before changing, `expected` means the dependency shape is normal for a shared primitive or composition root, and `risk_note` means edit carefully but do not assume a refactor is required. Human-readable audit output is grouped by actionability. When a lower-priority finding appears on the same file as a stronger actionable finding, it is marked as `secondary` so agents keep it as context instead of treating it as another independent action item. JSON and MCP output include both the compatibility-preserving flat `findings` array and grouped buckets under `groups`: `primary`, `secondary`, `actionable`, `candidates`, `risk_notes`, and `expected`. Agents should summarize from `groups` first and use `findings` only for full-detail traversal.

For MCP audit calls, `max_results` controls the number of returned findings. `max` is accepted as a compatibility alias, with `max_results` taking precedence when both are present. `config` is a TOML file path, not a named preset; strict mode is a separate CLI flag.

Dead-code candidates are limited to source-code symbols by default. Lexa skips style sheets, data/config files, package manifests, common framework config files, tests, generated artifacts, and declaration files to avoid reporting tooling keys, CSS tokens, or framework mount selectors as unused code.

Minimal audit config:
```
[audit]
max_findings = 100

[audit.thresholds]
large_file_warning = 800
large_file_high = 1500
large_symbol_warning = 120
large_symbol_high = 250
fan_in_warning = 15
fan_in_high = 40
fan_out_warning = 20
fan_out_high = 50

[audit.rules]
"architecture.cycle" = "high"
"file.large" = "warning"
"symbol.large" = "warning"
"dependency.hotspot" = "warning"
"dead_code.candidate" = "off"

[audit.ignore]
generated = true
paths = ["target/", "vendor/"]
findings = ["dependency.hotspot:src/main.rs"]

[audit.dead_code]
ignore_symbols = ["main", "handler", "setup"]
entrypoint_globs = ["src/main.*", "src/bin/", "pages/", "app/**"]
```
## MCP
Expose the same graph-backed tools to an MCP client:
```
lexa index /path/to/project
lexa mcp/path/to/project
```

MCP refreshes the graph before startup and watches the project while running. External edit events are applied to the same in-memory graph before the next MCP request is handled, so tools see fresh content without restarting the server. Run `lexa index` first when you want MCP to start from a fully rebuilt graph instead of relying on the cheaper startup freshness check. Disable both the startup refresh and runtime watcher when you want to trust the existing graph exactly:
```
lexa mcp /path/to/project --no-refresh
```

Tune the watcher debounce interval when needed:
```
lexa mcp /path/to/project --debounce 250
```

Run MCP without loading or saving a graph:
```
lexa --no-graph mcp /path/to/project
```

Example config:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexa": {
      "command": "/path/to/lexa",
      "args": ["mcp", "/path/to/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

Smoke benchmark baseline from June 3, 2026 on a generated Rust fixture corpus:

|  Benchmark  | Corups | Time |
|-------------|--------|------|
| `project_index/100` | 100 files | ~5.7 ms |
| `project_index/500` | 500 files | ~30.8 ms |
| `search/exact_word` | 1,000 files | ~57.6 us |
| `search/unique_token` | 1,000 files | ~192 us |
| `search/regex` | 1,000 files | ~54.1 us |
| `search/rich_scoped` | 1,000 files | ~92.9 us |
| `search/symbol_defs` | 1,000 files | ~91.5 us |
| `search/callers` | 1,000 files | ~97.0 us |
| `incremental_edit/single_file_reindex` | 500 files | ~1.1 ms |
| `snapshot/write` | 500 files | ~6.4 ms |
| `snapshot/load_into_engine` | 500 files | ~7.6 ms |

Treat these numbers as a local regression baseline. Hardware, filesystem, and full Criterion settings will shift absolute timings.

Lexa is ready to use. Graph format and output details may still evolve as the project grows.
